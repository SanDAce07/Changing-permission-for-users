# ASSIGNMNENT OF VLAN AND VLAN TRUNKING
# PROJECT INTERVLAN COMMUNICATION OF SCHOOL NETWORK

## TO ASSIGN VLAN TO DIFFERENT END DEVICES AND CONFIGURE THE SWITCH FOR INTER VLAN COMMUNICATION

THIS PROJECT IS A NETWORK SIMULATION OF A SCHOOL WITH MULTIPLE DEPARTMENT AND MULTIPLE END HOST. MY MAIN GOAL WITH THIS PROJECT IS TO ASSIGN VLAN SETTING FOR END DEVICES ON DIFFERENT SWITCH AND ENABLE INTER VLAN ROUTING BETWEEN DEVICES

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of VLAN CONCEPTS AND VLAN CONFIGURATION
- ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING OF VLAN AND INTER VLAN COMMUNICATION
- ABILITTY TO IDENTIFY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE VLANS
- ENHANCED KNOWLEDGE OF SUBNETTING WITH IPV4 ADDRESS
- ABILITY TO FIND RESOURCES TO HELP ME WITH SWITCH CONFIGURATION

### Tools Used

- PACKET TRACER FOR NETWORK SIMULATION
- ENDPOINT DEVICES THAT ARE PART OF DIFFERENT VLANS
- CISCO ROUTER AND SWITCH FOR NETWORK COMMUNICATION
## Steps
1. START BY FINDING THE DEPARTMENTS YOU WANT TO SEGMENT IN THE SCHOOL
2. CONFIGURE SWITCH AND SWITCHPORT TO YOUR SPECIFIC VLAN (PREFERABLY GET THE SWITCHPORT AWAY FROM VLAN 1 FOR SECURITY REASONS)
Example below.
